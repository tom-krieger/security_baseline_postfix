## Classes

### security_baseline_postfix

Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming mail and transfer
the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not intended to be a mail server, it
is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process local mail.

Rationale:
The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of security issues. While it
is important to ensure that the system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have the MTAs
daemon listening on a port unless the server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes
mail from other systems.
